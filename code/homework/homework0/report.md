# Adding Two Values
## Introduction
### What is the problem?
What we are trying to do is add two numbers together.
## Methods
### What algorithms did we use?
I simply used the + operator and assignment operator in order to 
create and add two variables (x, y) together, and assign that
value to the 'o' variable.
## Assumptions
### What assumptions and parameters did you use?
I assumed that the computer would correctly add the two variables
and that 'print' would not change the contents of 'o'
## Data
### Sample results
These are sample results that are enough to support my conclusion:
| X | Y | O |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 2 | 3 |
| 2 | 4 | 6 |
| 3 | 1 | 4 |
## Discussion
### What do the results mean?
These results can be verified using basic arithmetic, meaning that
the addition of the two variable within the code is correctly
implemented.
### What are the errors?
There are no errors.
## Conclusion
The code is able to add two variables and output the sum to the 
console.
