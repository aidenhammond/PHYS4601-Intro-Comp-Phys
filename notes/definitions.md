### Truncation

dropping insignificant digits

### Roundoff
if the fractional part of the insignificant digits >1/2 then increment the least significant digit by 1;
otherwise truncate. If the fractional part = 1/2, increment.

## How do we use computers to solve problems in physics?
a. Determine the questions that need to be answered.
b. Determine what relevant physics we already know
c. Construct a model for the system
- Simple enough to actually build a solution
- Complex enough that there is enough science behind it that the answer will have value
d. Choose a method of solution (solve for behavior of model)
e. Implement the method on a computer.
f. Visualize the result (could be a simple graph)
- plot
- table
- video
g. Draw a conclusion (so what?)
h. Compare to theory or experiment
i. Communicate
- Write a paper
- Give a talk

## Errors
* There are different general types of errors that may affect the precision or accuracy of a result and hence the interpretation
* **Systematic error** - Reproducible inaccuracy due to faulty method
* **Statistical error** - Inaccuracy or imprecision of a result due to finite precision of measurement and thus fluctuation in the result obtained from multiple independent measurements
* Note: Systematic error may arise from incorrect assumptions, use of a poor method, faulty implementation of the method, errors in the computer code, limits due to the computer, etc.

We need to know how big the error might behind.
